for our p2 we looked through some older sales data around holidays and quarterly sections
a few things came into play with the factors of sales such as local fuel prices, unemployment and holidays
we chose 5 different things to talk about	Which store has maximum sales?
						
						Which store/s has a good quarterly growth rate in Q3â€™2012?
						
						Provide a monthly view of sales for any chosen particular store in any given year.
						
						Which store has the maximum standard deviation?
						What does the standard deviation tell us, and what insights can we gain from it?

						Some holidays have a negative impact on sales. 
						Find out holidays which have higher sales than the mean sales in non-holiday seasons for all stores together.

we devised these queries based on a Walmart brand guide
